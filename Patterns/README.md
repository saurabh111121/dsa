## Pattern Template Examples

Each subfolder contains:
- Pattern explanation
- Template code
- Time/Space complexity
- Common variations
- Practice problems
- Real-world applications

## Learning Strategy

1. **Learn One Pattern at a Time**: Master before moving to next
2. **Solve Pattern-Specific Problems**: Focus on 5-10 problems per pattern
3. **Identify Patterns in New Problems**: Practice pattern recognition
4. **Combine Patterns**: Many problems use multiple patterns
5. **Create Your Own Templates**: Customize for quick recall
