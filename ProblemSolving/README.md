## Problem Solving Approach

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Understand the Problem**
   - Read carefully
   - Identify inputs and outputs
   - Note constraints
   - Ask clarifying questions

2. **Plan Your Approach**
   - Think of brute force solution first
   - Identify patterns
   - Consider edge cases
   - Think about optimization

3. **Choose Data Structure & Algorithm**
   - Which data structure fits best?
   - Which algorithm is most efficient?
   - Consider time and space tradeoffs

4. **Code the Solution**
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Use meaningful variable names

5. **Test Your Solution**
   - Test with provided examples
   - Test edge cases
   - Test with large inputs
   - Verify time and space complexity

6. **Optimize**
   - Can you reduce time complexity?
   - Can you reduce space complexity?
   - Is there a more elegant solution?

## Tips for Success

- **Start with Easy Problems**: Build confidence and fundamentals
- **Be Consistent**: Solve at least one problem daily
- **Understand, Don't Memorize**: Focus on patterns and concepts
- **Time Yourself**: Practice under interview conditions
- **Review Solutions**: Learn from others' approaches
- **Track Progress**: Maintain a log of solved problems
- **Revisit Problems**: Solve the same problem multiple times

## Problem Categories by Difficulty

### Easy (Beginner)
Focus on basic implementation and understanding

### Medium (Intermediate)
Requires combining multiple concepts

### Hard (Advanced)
Complex problems requiring advanced techniques
