# Data Structures

This folder contains implementations and examples of fundamental data structures.

## Structure

### Arrays
- Array operations (insertion, deletion, searching)
- Dynamic arrays
- 2D arrays and matrix operations
- Array problems and patterns

### LinkedLists
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List
- Common operations and problems

### Stacks
- Array-based stack
- Linked list-based stack
- Stack applications (expression evaluation, parentheses matching)
- Problems using stacks

### Queues
- Simple Queue
- Circular Queue
- Priority Queue
- Deque (Double-ended Queue)
- Queue applications

### Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
- B-Trees
- Tree traversals (Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order)

### Graphs
- Graph representations (Adjacency Matrix, Adjacency List)
- Graph traversals (BFS, DFS)
- Directed and Undirected graphs
- Weighted graphs

### Heaps
- Min Heap
- Max Heap
- Heap operations
- Priority Queue implementation
- Heap Sort

### HashTables
- Hash function implementations
- Collision resolution techniques
- Hash Map implementations
- Hash Set implementations

### Tries
- Trie (Prefix Tree) implementation
- Applications (autocomplete, spell checker)

### Sets
- Set operations
- Disjoint Set (Union-Find)

### Maps
- Map implementations
- TreeMap
- HashMap

## Learning Path

1. Start with Arrays - foundation of all data structures
2. Move to LinkedLists - understand pointers and references
3. Learn Stacks and Queues - LIFO and FIFO concepts
4. Study Trees - hierarchical data organization
5. Explore Graphs - complex relationships
6. Understand Heaps - specialized trees
7. Master HashTables - constant time operations
8. Learn advanced structures (Tries, Sets, Maps)

## Practice Approach

For each data structure:
1. Understand the concept and use cases
2. Implement from scratch
3. Learn time and space complexity
4. Solve related problems
5. Compare with other data structures
